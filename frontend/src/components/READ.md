This directory is designated for React components. Ensure they are named in PascalCase; otherwise, they might not function correctly.

Pages should not be stored here. This directory should exclusively contain components, such as:

-   ./Hero.jsx
-   ./DebateCard.jsx

For better organization, consider grouping them into subdirectories (categorized by client or admin if possible) like:

-   ./clientUI/Hero.jsx
-   ./adminUI/UsersList.jsx
